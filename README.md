### Introduction
- Welcome! This repository contains code used for analysis of HLA-Ab crystal structures for Sampurna Mukherjee (@SampurnaM) 's MPhil by thesis, titled "Computational Analysis of HLA-Ab interactions in the context of solid organ transplantation", submitted to Department of Biological Sciences, University of Cambridge in 2024.
- The code is organised in two Jupyter notebooks :
  1) The first Jupyter Notebook: Follows Objective 1 of the thesis - finding epitope residues for HLA-A*1101- 2e3 complex (PDB ID: 6ID4,https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pdbe/entry/pdb/6id4 ) using epitope features: Presence in antibody-antigen binding interface(distance), solvent accessibility and presence of non-covalent interactions (NCIs) computed as Interaction Fingerprints.
  The module sampurna_thesis ( https://github.com/SampurnaM/MPhil_HLA_Ab/blob/main/sampurna_thesis.py) was written for this analysis and is used in the notebook for computing epitope features

  2) The second Jupyter notebook: Follows Objective 2 of the thesis - computing the same epitope features across multiple conformations generated by molecular dynamics simulations.
     - Simulation software: GROMACS 2022
     - Key packages: MDAnalysis and ProLIF
  Notebook link: https://github.com/SampurnaM/MPhil_HLA_Ab/blob/main/objective2_md_analysis_and_plotting.ipynb
- Finally, the molecular dynamics simulations were performed on EMBL-EBI's CODON cluster and the system setup was performed by launching Jupyter Notebooks inside CODON-SLURM cluster. The setup notebook is available at : https://github.com/SampurnaM/MPhil_HLA_Ab/blob/main/GROMACS_MD_setup.ipynb
